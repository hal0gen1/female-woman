    <p>random notes and stuff here because i want to </p>

    <p>this website probably looks really bad if you view it on a screen that has a wider ratio than 3:1 because then the comic pages will automatically have 3 pages on 1 line. but hopefully no one is viewing it on that wide of a screen because wtf do you need all that screen for.</p>
